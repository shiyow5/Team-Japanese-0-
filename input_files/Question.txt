get my trunks and get ready for dinner that is all for to day asked still feeling the duties assigned to be very strange ones that is all and to morrow will be very much like it smiled the the dinner is it to be at a private house no mr inquisitive at a public the day was certainly the most agreeable that had spent for months as he said to himself when he lay at last among his pillows he had dined with several friends of mr who had treated him with the courtesy due a foreigner and love astray stranger who comes with a good introduction after the dinner all had gone rather late to one of the theatres where devoted less attention to the play than to a family in one of the opposite boxes among whom was one of the most beautiful young girls he had ever seen wearing an appearance of reserve that amounted almost to sadness and which excited his utmost interest he noted that mr exchanged bows with an elderly lady in that party who seemed to be the young lady s mother but the appeared so well known that from the various boxes were the rule rather than the exception an unusually pretty girl that was all that mr said about her except to add and a of yours by the way chapter vi then there s a father too it was in the morning as the clock was striking nine that gray awoke he sprang out of bed with a he was his duties and then that there were none to perform he rang and requested the domestic to ask mr if mr had arrived or if any message had been received from him a negative reply was received and a light breakfast was served in his rooms somewhat to his surprise for nothing had been said then s a father too about that when he had eaten and dressed he strolled out of doors to his and returned about eleven o clock to find the busy at his desk how are you this morning was the question that greeted him quite well i am sure judging from your appearance i have a lot to do just now and shall have to beg you to excuse me at lunch but if you are here at four i shall be glad of your company for a drive nothing particular to say i suppose nothing said gray for was present and his character as a genuine friend of mr was at stake i should advise you to lunch at the to day continued mr with his eyes on the papers he was examining to morrow i will put you up at my club where things are much better you found the morning newspapers in your room i hope i told the man to have them for you when you awoke it was a strange kind of employment dining with a party of gentlemen being taken to the theatre given an elegant of rooms to live in and a drive in the park for the afternoon the manner of mr took away the feeling that might otherwise have the enjoyment of these things and strove to overcome his few remaining scruples at present he saw no reason to refuse the change of life he had been terribly tired of the narrow quarters he had occupied and the miserable meals he had been obliged to eat if it that the wished to be repaid for his kindness by the gone a of anything inconsistent with honor felt that he was fully able to meet the he could not however reconcile a fear of this sort with the correct and the position in society which his new friend gave

your money oh no replied the young man earnestly if i remain in london i shall be almost sure to meet him again and the amount is not so vital to me as it was yesterday very well but if you meet him

which were seated the young lady and her mother that had noticed at the theatre the preceding night as the passed closely to each other both gentlemen lifted their hats and then there s a father too
